# When you select a contiguous block of text in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently. For example:
# PDF-highighting.png
# In this challenge, you will be given a list of letter heights in the alphabet and a string. Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in  assuming all letters are  wide.
#For example, the highlighted . Assume the heights of the letters are  and . The tallest letter is  high and there are  letters. The hightlighted area will be  so the answer is .

height = [int(h_temp) for h_temp in input().strip().split(' ')]
word = input().strip()

length = max([h[ord(i)-97] for i in word])
print(length*len(word))
